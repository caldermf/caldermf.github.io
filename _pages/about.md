I am a fifth-year PhD student at MIT, working under the supervision of Roman Bezrukavnikov. I am interested in the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics, particularly in the context of geometric representation theory. Starting in July 2024, I will be a Szeg&#337; Assistant Professor at Stanford University.
