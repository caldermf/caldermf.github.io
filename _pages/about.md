I am a Gibbs Assistant Professor at Yale University. I am interested in the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics, particularly in the context of geometric representation theory. From 2024-2025, I was a Szeg&#337; Assistant Professor at Stanford University. From 2019-2024, I completed my PhD at MIT under the supervision of Roman Bezrukavnikov.
