I am a fifth-year PhD student at MIT, working under the supervision of Roman Bezrukavnikov. I am interested in the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics, particularly in the context of geometric representation theory.

In the links above, you can find information about my current and previous research, things I've been learning about lately, my teaching, and mathematical notes I've made available.
