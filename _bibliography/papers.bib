abstract={In their 1988 paper "Gluing of perverse sheaves and discrete series representations," D. Kazhdan and G. Laumon constructed an abelian category A associated to a reductive group G over a finite field with the aim of using it to construct discrete series representations of the finite Chevalley group G(F_q). The well-definedness of their construction depended on their conjecture that this category has finite cohomological dimension. This was disproven by R. Bezrukavnikov and A. Polishchuk in 2001, who found a counterexample in the case G = SL_3. In the same paper, Polishchuk then made an alternative conjecture: though this counterexample shows that the Grothendieck group K_0(A)$ is not spanned by objects of finite projective dimension, he noted that a graded version of K_0(A) can be thought of as a module over Laurent polynomials and conjectured that a certain localization of this module is generated by objects of finite projective dimension, and suggested that this conjecture could lead toward a proof that Kazhdan and Laumon's construction is well-defined. He proved this conjecture in Types A_1, A_2, A_3, and B_2. In the present paper, we prove Polishchuk's conjecture in full generality, and go on to prove that Kazhdan and Laumon's construction is indeed well-defined, giving a new geometric construction of discrete series representations of G(F_q).},

abstract={We study the categories of Iwahori-equivariant perverse sheaves on the thin and thick affine flag varieties associated to a split reductive group G. An earlier work of the first author describes perverse sheaves on the thin flag variety in terms of bimodules over the so-called non-commutative Springer resolution. We partly extend this result to the thick flag variety, providing a similar description for its anti-spherical quotient. The long intertwining functor realizes sheaves on the thick flag variety as the Ringel dual of the category of sheaves on the thick flag variety, we point out that it shares some exactness properties with the similar functor acting on perverse sheaves on the finite-dimensional flag variety. We use this result to resolve a conjecture of Arkhipov and the first author, proving that the image in the Iwahori-Whittaker category of any convolution-exact perverse sheaf on the affine flag variety is tilting.},

abstract={Given a complex representation of a finite group, Brauer and Nesbitt defined in 1941 its reduction mod p, obtaining a representation over the algebraic closure of ùîΩ_p. In 2021, Lusztig studied the characters obtained by reducing mod p an irreducible unipotent representation of a finite reductive group over ùîΩ_p. He gave a conjectural formula for this character as a linear combination of terms which had no explicit definition and were only known in some small-rank examples. In this paper we provide an explicit formula for these terms and prove Lusztig's conjecture, giving a formula for the reduction mod p of any unipotent representation of G(ùîΩ_q) for q a power of p. We also propose a conjecture linking this construction to the full exceptional collection in the derived category of coherent sheaves on a partial flag variety constructed recently by Samokhin and van der Kallen.},

	abstract = {Fix a simply-laced semisimple Lie algebra. We study the crystal B(nŒª), were Œª is a dominant minuscule weight and n is a natural number. On one hand, B(nŒª) can be realized combinatorially by height n reverse plane partitions on a heap associated to Œª. On the other hand, we use this heap to define a module over the preprojective algebra of the underlying Dynkin quiver. Using the work of Saito and Savage-Tingley, we realize B(nŒª) via irreducible components of the quiver Grassmannian of n copies of this module. In this paper, we describe an explicit bijection between these two models for B(nŒª) and prove that our bijection yields an isomorphism of crystals. Our main geometric tool is Nakajima's tensor product quiver varieties.},
