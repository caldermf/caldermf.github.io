abstract={We define and study an analogue of Category O in the context of Kazhdan and Laumon's gluing construction for perverse sheaves on the basic affine space. We explicitly describe the simple objects in this category, and we show its linearized Grothendieck group is isomorphic to a natural submodule of Lusztig's periodic Hecke module. We then provide a categorification of these results by showing that the Kazhdan-Laumon Category O is equivalent to a full subcategory of a suitably-defined category of perverse sheaves on the semi-infinite flag variety.},

abstract={We explicitly identify the algebra generated by symplectic Fourier-Deligne transforms (i.e. convolution with Kazhdan-Laumon sheaves) acting on the Grothendieck group of perverse sheaves on the basic affine space G/U, answering a question originally raised by A. Polishchuk. We show it is isomorphic to a distinguished subalgebra, studied by I. Marin, of the generalized algebra of braids and ties (defined in Type A by F. Aicardi and J. Juyumaya and generalized to all types by Marin), providing a connection between geometric representation theory and an algebra defined in the context of knot theory. Our geometric interpretation of this algebra entails some algebraic consequences: we obtain a short and type-independent geometric proof of the braid relations for Juyumaya's generators of the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra (previously proved case-by-case in types A, D, E by Juyumaya and separately for types B, C, F₄, G₂ by Juyumaya and S. S. Kannan), a natural candidate for an analogue of a Kazhdan-Lusztig basis, and finally an explicit formula for the dimension of Marin's algebra in Type Aₙ (previously only known for n≤4).},

abstract={Fix a simply-laced semisimple Lie algebra. We study the crystal B(nλ), were λ is a dominant minuscule weight and n is a natural number. On one hand, B(nλ) can be realized combinatorially by height n reverse plane partitions on a heap associated to λ. On the other hand, we use this heap to define a module over the preprojective algebra of the underlying Dynkin quiver. Using the work of Saito and Savage-Tingley, we realize B(nλ) via irreducible components of the quiver Grassmannian of n copies of this module. In this paper, we describe an explicit bijection between these two models for B(nλ) and prove that our bijection yields an isomorphism of crystals. Our main geometric tool is Nakajima's tensor product quiver varieties.},
